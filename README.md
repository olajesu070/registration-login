# Step : Start the Application

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

Start the backend server by running the following command:

cd server
node server.js


# Open another terminal or command prompt (while still in the project's root directory) and 
start the React development server:
npm start

Your application will open in your default browser, and you should be able to access the registration and login pages.
That's it! You have now created a registration and login page using React.js for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend.
